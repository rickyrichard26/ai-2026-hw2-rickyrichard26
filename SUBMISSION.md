## AI tool disclosure

State which AI tools you used and for what. Expected and fine; undisclosed use
is not. If you used a model to help you draft a prompt, say which prompt.

## Sublab Easy â€” one task, four roles

### Decisions per role

One row per enquiry. In each cell write the `decision` your run returned, and
whether it agrees with `expected` in `data/enquiries.json`:

| Enquiry | policy_officer | front_desk | auditor | bilingual_clerk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 | | | | |
| E-02 | | | | |
| E-03 | | | | |
| E-04 | | | | |
| E-05 | | | | |
| E-06 | | | | |
| E-07 | | | | |
| E-08 | | | | |
| E-09 | | | | |
| E-10 | | | | |
| **agrees with `expected`** | /10 | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| **parsed** | /10 | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| **schema-valid** | /10 | /10 | /10 | /10 |

### Which field moved, on which enquiry, under which role

| Field | Enquiries that moved | Role(s) that moved it |
|---|---|---|
| `found` | | |
| `decision` | | |
| `amount` | | |
| `missing_documents` | | |

Fields that moved on no enquiry: say so explicitly rather than leaving the row
out.

### Raw replies

Paste the full reply for **one enquiry where a role changed the decision** away
from the policy officer's:

```
```

Paste the full reply for **E-07 (the Kazakh enquiry)** from the bilingual
clerk, so the `reason` language is visible:

```
```

### Written answers

**1. Which fields are role-sensitive and which are not?** Point at rows in your
tables.

>

**2. Which enquiries are most sensitive to the role, and why those?** Say what
E-03, E-04, E-07 and E-10 are each testing.

>

**3. Where does discretion belong â€” the role paragraph, or code that reads
`decision` afterwards?** Say what a downstream program can and cannot tell
about which role produced a record.

>

**4. Is a role a boundary?** Say in Week 2 terms what the role paragraph is
made of, and what you would put in code â€” not in the prompt â€” if a wrong
`decision` were expensive.

## Sublab Medium â€” memory you choose

### Tokens per call

| Call | A â€” never compressed | B â€” compressed at the `compress` turn |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |
| 5 | | |
| 6 | | |
| 7 | | |
| 8 | | |
| 9 | | |
| 10 | | |
| 11 | | |
| 12 | | |
| **peak** | | |
| **total for the run** | | |

### Probes after the conversation

| Probe | Tests | A retrieved? | A answer | B retrieved? | B answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-1 identity | turn 1 | | | | |
| Q-2 missing document | turn 5 | | | | |
| Q-3 band and amount | turns 3â€“4 | | | | |
| Q-4 the constraint | turn 6 | | | | |
| Q-5 the open question | turn 7 | | | | |
| **retrieved** | | /5 | | /5 | |

### The state my compression produced

```json
```

### Written answers

**1. What did compression buy?** Peak tokens both ways, probes retrieved both
ways, and â€” if a probe was lost â€” which one and which turn it came from.

>

**2. Why must the state be structured rather than a paragraph?** You could have
asked for "a summary". Say what changes when the summary is an object with
named fields.

>

**3. What is missing from your state that you would add?** Name what you would
add and what you would drop to pay for it.

>

**4. When is compression the wrong choice?** Name a conversation where it would
lose something that cannot be recovered, and say whether your program would
notice.

## Sublab Hard â€” stories in, CVs out, the best candidate by code

### Part 1 â€” extraction

| Story | Parsed? | Valid? | Fields that came back `null` | Traps hit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| story-01 | | | | |
| story-02 | | | | |
| story-03 | | | | |
| story-04 | | | | |
| story-05 | | | | |
| story-06 | | | | |

The four traps, for reference: no GPA stated Â· a GPA on another scale Â· a paper
that is not published Â· a story that contradicts itself.

Paste the extraction for **story-06**, the one that contradicts itself:

```json
```

### Part 2 â€” scores and the winner

| Candidate | academic (0â€“5) | research (0â€“5) | experience (0â€“5) | weighted total (code) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| story-01 | | | | |
| story-02 | | | | |
| story-03 | | | | |
| story-04 | | | | |
| story-05 | | | | |
| story-06 | | | | |

**Winner, computed by my code:**

**The model's prose answer, asked separately ("who should win?"):**

>
```

### Part 3 â€” written answers

**1. Which rule did you have to add, and what broke without it?** Name the
story that forced it.

>

**2. Where did the model guess, and where did your code have to decide?** One
example of each, from your run.

>

**3. Did your prose ranking and your computed ranking agree?** Say which one
you trust and why â€” and if they agreed, what you would need to see before
trusting the prose one alone.

>

**4. The rubric has no anchor for a contradicted field.** The stories say 3.2
and then 3.5; the rubric defines a 0 and a 5 and nothing in between for this
case. Say what you did and what the rule should be.

>

**5. How close were your top two candidates?** If they were within 0.05, say
what you would tell the committee and what you would change in the extraction
to make that call defensible.

## Reflection (optional, one short paragraph)

Having now written a role prompt, compressed a conversation, and ranked six
extractions â€” what will you do differently the next time you build something
that has to get reliable structured output out of a model?
